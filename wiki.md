# AI and Hollywood

Growing in relevancy is AI both in and around Hollywood. AI for voice manipulation, actor de-aging, visual effects, and AI-generated video creation are painted as the natural stepping stones of filmmaking technology, and on the other hand, as direct threats to creative labor and copyright protections.



## Neutral Viewpoint
AI is currently being deployed as a production tool rather than a full replacement for human creators. Many films, like Oscar-nominated movies Emilia Perez and The Brutalist, have discreetly used AI to alter voices. AI has also been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford. Production company Particle6 have even created an AI character Tilly Norwood. Studios and independent creators are experimenting with AI in storyboarding, dubbing, subtitling, and concept visualization, but the long-term role of AI in Hollywood remains uncertain.


## Pro-AI Viewpoint
Supporters argue that AI can democratize filmmaking in how it would allow small creators to produce blockbuster-level visuals at a fraction of the cost. Companies like Moonvalley claim AI can be developed ethically by compensating filmmakers or actors used as training data. Advocates say AI can unlock creativity and aid in creating sets and worlds that are otherwise not easy to access or invent, thus making it a super tool, similar to CGI or green screens before it.


## Anti-AI Viewpoint 
Critics, like some Hollywood filmmakers, warn that AI could replace human performers, writers, and crew, in particular, background actors and voice artists. Some actors are pushing for contracts that guarantee their likeness and voices cannot be used to train AI models without explicit consent. In addition, there are concerns about copyright infringement, as AI models are allegedly trained on films, scripts, and performances without consent. Under dispute is the control over IP that is used in AI-generated videos produced using Sora, and how much owners should be compensated.
